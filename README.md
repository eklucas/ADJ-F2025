Welcome to Advanced Data Journalism for Fall 2025. This repository will eventually hold all the scripts we work through in class as well as additional resources for your learning (many of which you can also find in Canvas). 

Each class period I will commit the code that we work through.

Because GitHub is not meant to hold large data files, you will find most of the data files we use in class on Canvas. 

The [tipsheets](/tipsheets) folder has the following resources: 
-   Tidyverse Cheatsheets: 
	- data-import.pdf
	- data-transformation.pdf
	- data-visualization.pdf
	- lubridate.pdf
	- purrr.pdf
	- strings.pdf
	- tidy.pdf
-   [R-Functions](https://eklucas.github.io/ADJ-F2025/tipsheets/R-Functions.html): a guide to the basic R functions that will be most useful to you in analyzing data (consider this a good list of functions you should master by the end of the semester).
-   [ChatGPT group_by() helper](https://github.com/eklucas/ADJ-F2025/blob/main/tipsheets/ChatGPT%20group_by%20helper.pdf): a guide (written helpfully by ChatGPT) to understanding how grouping affects other functions.
-   [R-dictionary](https://eklucas.github.io/ADJ-F2025/tipsheets/R-dictionary.html): a list of vocabularly that we will use over and over again to refer to various features of the R language.
